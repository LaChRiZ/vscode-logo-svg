# VS Code Logo

This is a fork of [auchenbergs vscode-logo-svg][auchenbergs-vscode].

I recreated the logo with [Inkscape][inkscape] and added a optimized version for T-shirt prints.  
In this file (`vscode-logo-layered.svg`) I've separated all elements to own layers. So it's easier to handle for T-Shirt print services like spreadshirt.com.
